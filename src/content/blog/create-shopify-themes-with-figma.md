Shopify seems to be all of the rage these days since everyone is creating small businesses. Creating Shopify themes can be extremely lucative. I created a [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD__2TPFm0LhKkmssvmUIMKlKwpn3btVj) on YouTube on building themes and the attached video will walkthrough building a theme for Shopify in Figma. The video is a bit old, but should still hold up.
