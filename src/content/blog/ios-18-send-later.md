The introduction of iOS 18 brings an array of new features. Among these, the "Send Later" feature in the Message app stands out, providing users the ability to schedule messages to be sent at a later time. This feature is particularly useful for managing communication across different time zones or sending a message you don't want to respond to immediately. In this article, we will guide you through the steps to use "Send Later" in the iOS 18 Developer Preview. Note: the feature only works with iMessage recipents.

## Enabling the Developer Preview:

Before you can use "Send Later," you need to have the iOS 18 Developer Preview installed on your device. Ensure you are enrolled in the Apple Developer Program, then follow these steps:

## Backup Your Device:

Before installing any beta software, it's crucial to back up your device using iCloud or your computer.
Download the Beta Profile: Visit the Apple Developer website, sign in, and download the iOS 18 beta profile to your device.

## Install the Beta:

Go to Settings > General > Software Update > Beta Updates, and you should see the iOS 18 developer beta available for download.

Once you have iOS 18 installed, follow these steps to use the "Send Later" feature in the Messages app:

### Step 1: Compose Your Message

Open the Messages app on your iOS device. Tap the compose button (a square with a pencil icon) to start a new message or open a conversation (with an iMessage user). Enter your message as you usually would.

### Step 2: Schedule the message

After composing your message, tap the plus button and menu will appear with several options. Hit "More" and then you will see "Send Later."

### Step 3: Set the Sending Time

The screen will return to the conversation with a default time filled to send. Click to change the time to whatever you desire. Tap the message box to close the datetime picker.

### Step 4: Confirm and Save

Ensure all details are correct and then tap the send arrow per usual. Your message will now be scheduled and stored in the conversation until the specified time.

## Managing Scheduled Messages:

You can review, edit, alter time or cancel scheduled messages before they are sent.

### Edit Scheduled Message:

Tap and hold on the message you want to edit, make your changes, and then hit the check to confirm changes.

### Alter Scheduled Message Time:

Under "Send Later" in a conversation, tap edit above a conversation you want and hit "Edit Time". Modify the time with the inline datetime picker and tap out of the picker to confirm time.

### Cancel Scheduled Message:

Under "Send Later" in a conversation, tap edit above a conversation you want and hit "Delete Message". It will not confirm a delete and your message will be deleted.


The "Send Later" feature in iOS 18 is a powerful tool for managing your text communications more effectively or just deferring conversations until you are ready.
